# 16-bit-ALU-
This project implements a 16-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) capable of performing basic arithmetic and logical operations such as addition, subtraction, AND, OR, XOR, shifts, and comparison. The ALU operates on two 16-bit inputs, uses control signals to select operations, and generates status flags like Zero, Carry, Overflow, and Sign.
