# 16-bit-ALU
This project implements a 16-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) capable of performing a wide range of arithmetic and logical operations on two 16-bit binary inputs. The ALU is a fundamental component of a CPU and is designed to demonstrate core digital logic concepts used in processors and embedded systems.

The ALU supports operations such as addition, subtraction, bitwise AND, OR, XOR, NOT, shift, and comparison, selected through a control signal. It generates standard status flags including Zero, Carry, Overflow, and Sign, enabling effective result evaluation and decision-making in higher-level control units.

The design emphasizes modularity, clarity, and efficiency, making it suitable for learning purposes, academic projects, and integration into simple processor architectures. This implementation can be extended to support additional operations or scaled to higher bit widths.

Key Features:

16-bit wide data path

Multiple arithmetic and logical operations

Control-signal-based operation selection

Status flag generation (Zero, Carry, Overflow, Sign)

Suitable for educational and processor design applications
